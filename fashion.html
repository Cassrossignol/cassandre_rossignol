        <p> My passions for fashion and marketing were enriched during my <strong>human</strong> and <strong>cultural adventures </strong>, notably in China and Poland. Building my professional project around these two interests has been obvious to me since I was very young. 
        My bachelor's degree at the <strong>Institut Supérieur Européenne de la Mode (ISEM)</strong> allowed me to make this dream come true. During these three years, the projects uniting fashion, marketing and communication have not stopped multiplying. Thanks to them and to the speakers, I developed a <strong>fashion culture </strong>, a <strong>product sensitivity</strong> and a <strong>sense of analysis</strong> of the different markets and fashion trends.</p>

      <p> Since I entered graduate school, each of my choices and experiences have actively contributed to the realization of my professional ambitions. ISEM gave me the opportunity to do three internships. All of them brought me qualities and skills that are essential to work in the fashion industry and more particularly in marketing. In my choice of company, I have always favored the curiosity of learning new jobs and new worlds.</p>

              <p> As close as possible to the client, I <strong>immersed myself</strong> in his world. 
              First, as an ambassador of the OFF-WHITE brand during a <strong>unique exhibition at Le Bon Marché</strong>. For a month I discovered, advised, exchanged and shared moments with an international clientele, notably with Koreans and Chinese. 
              During the summer, I changed my universe and discovered a more masculine world by being a sales consultant at <strong>Le Printemps Haussmann</strong> for the swimwear department. For 4 months we immersed the consumer in a new experience. The floor was transformed into a place of <strong>meeting, sharing, and human happiness</strong>. Each element reminded us of the beach, for a few moments we allowed the customer to escape and imagine himself at the beach, playing petanque and enjoying with his friends, without forgetting his perfect swimsuit. </p>

              <p> My internship at the multi-brand site monshowroom.com as a <strong>marketplace assistant</strong> was a real introduction to <strong>operational responsibility</strong>. Through this experience I discovered the marketplace business model, a must for an e-commerce website. This one allows above all to propose a wider offer of products compared to a classic business model. All my missions were related to this program, since the heart of my job was to <strong>meet the needs</strong> of the consumer and to <strong>satisfy the customer's needs</strong>. As soon as the commercial agreements were finalized, I contacted the partners in order to help them put their offer online. Via a technical platform, <strong>Mirakl</strong>, I checked that the brands' imports were updated in order to ensure that the offer was uploaded to the site. Contrary to the initial policy of a marketplace, which is to reach millions of references in record time, MSR keeps a control on the referencing of the products visible on the site. This particularity allowed me to select, with the help of the commercial, the future products of the site. Moreover, MSR maintains its image, that's why a graphic charter was imposed to each seller. I made sure that the products were put online, their visuals, the partnership and the contract clauses (logistics, customer service, offer etc.) were maintained. During these six months, I had to show <strong>adaptability and autonomy</strong> in front of an unknown job. </p>

              <p> My internship at the designer brand Demeure was ideal to understand how a company works. The multi-faceted position I held was very formative, I participated in the activities of a communications and marketing assistant as well as the creation of the fall winter 2017 collection.
              To ensure the development of the collection, I performed a constant <strong>analysis of the markets, emerging trends and consumer behaviors</strong>. 
              During <strong>trade shows</strong> (Maison & Objet, Playtime, Première Vision and Who's Next) my role was to prospect future private and professional clients. </p>
