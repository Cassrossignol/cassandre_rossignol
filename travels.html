        <h1> "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.” - <b> Saint Augustine </b> </h1>
        <p> I had the chance to live abroad for 12 years, 8 years in Poland and 4 years in China. These years of <strong>expatriation</strong> have allowed me to travel, to discover cultures, landscapes and splendid universes. They enrich me every day, they make my strength and have given me this desire for <strong>challenge</strong> and <strong>ambition</strong>. </p>

      <p> I discovered different stories, different <strong>cultures</strong> but also different ways of life.  Abroad I learned to <strong>communicate in several languages</strong>, to <strong>open up to others</strong> and to <strong>listen</strong>.  At each new destination, I had to adapt, integrate, rebuild a circle of friends, find a new balance and overcome difficulties. Each trip is a <strong>unique experience</strong>, they have the power to <strong>enrich</strong> my personality and my vision of the world. Recently, my trip to Australia confirmed my professional choices. During four months, I travelled, discovered a new culture in complete <strong>autonomy</strong>.From Sydney to Cairns we shared the best moments of our lives, as well as the most difficult ones.</p>
